File save hooks
===============
You can configure functions that are run whenever a file is saved. There are
two hooks available:
* ``ContentsManager.pre_save_hook`` runs on the API path and model with
  content. This can be used for things like stripping output that people don't
  like adding to VCS noise.
* ``FileContentsManager.post_save_hook`` runs on the filesystem path and model
  without content. This could be used to commit changes after every save, for
  instance.
